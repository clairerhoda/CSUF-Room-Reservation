# CSUFRoomReservation
This website application allows students to reserve study rooms that are 
available in the Pollak Library through a reservation system. Students 
must log in using their CSUF login credentials in order to reserve a 
room. Each student can reserve a room in 30 minutes increments with a 
3 hour reservation limit. Rooms that are available can be sorted 
based on room size and chair/desks amount. In the web application, 
the user can browse rooms and available time slots, set a reservation 
time, and cancel a reservation. The student can choose to add friends 
to notify of the room reservation details.
